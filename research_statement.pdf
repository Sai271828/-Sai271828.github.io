I am primarily interested in Algebraic topology, in particular in chromatic homotopy theory. 
One of the fundamental problems of homotopy thoery is to study the homotopy groups of spheres. 
Due to Serre, we know that these homotopy groups are more or less finite abelian groups.
For finite abelian groups, we can localise and study them and we can put all this information together to complete the whole calculation.
It turns out the compation of these localisatins is still very hard. 
Later due to Rvaenel miller wilson, it was realised that the homotopy groups can be thought of as a module over a stack which has more points than just the integers.
This is the called the moduli stack and it has all the primes, but over every prime there is a sequence pof ideals one for every height. The problem I am interested in , is understanding these finer localisations which are more amenable to understanding.
The localisations at hieght are more or less well understood and I am inntersted in understanding the localisation at height 2
Broadly there are two problems I am interested in
In a project with undergrads, we are currently try to calculate the kernel and cokernel of a map defined on modular forms
Computational aspect

Theoretical aspect Another question I am intereted is is called Descent.
